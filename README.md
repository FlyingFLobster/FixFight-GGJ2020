# FixFight-GGJ2020
My Global Game Jam 2020 project, FixFight!
(Jam Page: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/fixfight-2)

I made this sort of micro-rpg using the Monogame Framework during the 2020 Global Game Jam at the Let's Make Games SAE jam site.
All the design, programming, sound, music, and art was put together by me in just under 48 hours. I'm pretty proud of it!

Beware looking at the code too closely because as the the hours passed and my stamina wained, it started to get pretty smelly.
But if you do want a closer look, all you should need to be able to compile and run it is .NET 3.1 and the Monogame Framework installed.
